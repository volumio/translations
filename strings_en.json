English tends to provide more accurate results.<br /> <br />By enabling Autoplay, once the search is completed, the matched tracks will be played<br /> <br />Notes: <br /><br /><ul><li>To get the best from SuperSearch you should have at least one streaming service connected, such as TIDAL, QOBUZ or Spotify</li><li>If you don't have any of the above, it's suggested that your local library consists of at least 1000 tracks</li></ul>",
